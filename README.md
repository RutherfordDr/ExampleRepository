# MatrixCalculator
This calculator allows users to choose between three different calculators; a basic calculator, scientific calculator, and matrix calculator.


Compiling/Running the code:

To run the program, the user will first need to compile the code. In most cases, the project will be in the Downloads folder. If not, find the location of the program on your computer. Once found, open the file Demo3 and then copy the information found written in the location bar; the default location should be /home/ugd/Username/Downloads/Demo3. Once copied, open Terminal and write 'cd' then paste the location of the Demo3 folder. Next, to compile the code, write the line 'javac CalculatorGUI'. Finally, to run the code type the line 'java computerGUI' this will cause a pop-up menu to appear and start the code.

Operating Instructions:
- First, follow the steps listed in Compiling/Running the code, if done correctly a new window should open up displaying four options; 'Basic Calculator', 'Scientific Calculator', 'Matrix Calculator', and 'History'.
- Click whichever calculator fits your current needs or click the history button to display all operations done in this current session.
- If using the scientific calculator, the symbols indicated by the button correspond to those mathematical operations and will operate exactly like a regular scientific calculator.
- If the matrix calculator is chosen, then a different screen will appear. Similar to the scientific calculator, the symbols on the button represent mathematical operations that can be used. The button labelled 'T', stands for transpose; 'RREF' stands for reduced-row echelon form; 'S' stands for scalar multiplication. Once done, the user can input numbers into the text field but will need to use a space or a comma to indicate the start of a new number. The numbers will be placed from left to right, meaning the first number is row one column one and the second is row one column two and so on. 
- The history button will reveal the history of calculations done in that calculator and using the arrow buttons on the GUI the user can decide whthers to import that equation back into the calculator if they want. The history will show history from past sesions as well so closing the program will not erase the history on top of this the history will not automatically update if the window is open. By clicking the 'Update History' buttons users will be able to update the history while the window is open and the history will update to display every equation the user input since opening the history or updating the hsitory whichever came first.
